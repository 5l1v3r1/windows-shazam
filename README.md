# Overview #
[Shazam](http://www.shazam.com) is a popular music identification service for smartphones.
It works really good, but it doesn't have a version for Windows 7 computers.
_windows-shazam_ is a little software that takes a sample of music from your microphone, and recongnize it by sending it to Shazam's servers.

It basically does exactly the same thing as the official Shazam app, but on your windows 7 computer instead of your smartphone.

## About ##
This software listens to a 10-seconds sample from your default microphone. Then it sends it to Shazam's server at http://msft.shazamid.com/orbit/DoRecognition1, and causes it to think the request was sent from a smartphone.

### Usage ###
_windows-shazam_ is a portable software, so you don't have to install anything. Just run it, and make sure it has the essential DLLs in the same folder.

**NOTICE**: I haven't tested it on multiple computers, so if something doesn't work, please let me know.
