# Before Running #

If you want _windows-shazam_ to hear your music clearly, you may want it to listen on your sound card, so it will record **only** the audio from your computer.
_windows-shazam_ will always listen to your default microphone, so you'd have to change your default microphone.

To do that, Go to Control Panel -> Sound -> Recording and choose the one with the sound card icon. Click 'Set Default'.
If you can't see a sound card icon, your computer probably doesn't support it.
Notice: Make sure to change back your default recording device when you're done with it.

# Running #

Once you downloaded the software, extract it and run shazam.exe.
You need to have .NET 4.0 Installed. If you don't have it, you can download it from here: http://www.microsoft.com/enus/download/details.aspx?id=17851
You can also make a desktop shortcut for it. Just make sure the DLL files are in the same folder of the actual executable.

# Usage #
Using this software is very simple. Make sure your music is playing and that your microphone can record it. When it is playing, simply click the big 'Shazam!' button. After 10 seconds, it will tell you what is the name of the song you just heared.

Once the name appeared on the screen, you can stop playing the song.
